# Data-Science-Projects
**1. Coursera Guided Project: Telecom Customers Churn Prediction**
- Prediction of Telecommunication customers churn rate using several classification algorithms namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest Classfier.
- Telecom service providers use customer attrition analysis as one of their key business metrics, as the cost of retaining exisiting customer is lower than acquiring a new one.
- Machine learning algorithms help companies analyze customer attrition rate based on several factors such as subscribed services, tenure rate, gender, senior citizen status and payment method.

**2. Deploy Machine Learning Model into AWS Cloud Servers**
- Create a Flask application
- Build a RESTful API - GET/POST method
- Build a machine-learning based spam detector API
- Launch an AWS EC2 instance using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Deploy ML model into AWS virtual servers
- Perform additional AWS Elastic Beanstalk actions: Application versioning, Server logs, Server performance monitoring & Terminate the server
